# Revealing human planning strategies with eye tracking

Thanks for reviewing our paper!

This is a temporary anonymous storage space for the materials supporting our submission. It includes all the data and analysis code needed to produce the results in the paper. However, it is not user-friendly at the moment, and the only way to access the data is through the provided Julia code. This will be rectified before the camera-ready version. All the results can be generated with `julia main.jl`. Results end up in figs/ and stats/.

## Trial Videos
The most interesting thing here is probably the videos in eye-videos. For now, it's just 5 trials per participant (they're slow to generate!) The red dot indicates gaze and the black dot indicates mouse position (because why not?) They're all at half speed. The rewards turn black when the gaze contingency was activated.
